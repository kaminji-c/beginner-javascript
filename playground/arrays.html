  <h1>Arrays</h1>
  <p>An array is used for holding a list of items where the ORDER matters. Each thing inside of an array is called an
    ITEM and its POSITION in an array is called an INDEX</p>
  <p>NUMBERS inside of an array is called a LENGTH</p>
  <p>EACH item inside of an array can be ANY TYPE</p>
  <p>Similar to an object except there are NO KEYS</p>
  <p>The KEYS will be INDEXES so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>
  <p>Array is not its own TYPE, at the end of the day its an OBJECT</p>
  <p>Best way to check if something is an array is using the Array.isArray (static) method: Array.isArray();
  </p>
  <p>Arrays are zero based. Index counting starts at 0</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Mutable Methods</h2>
  <p>Perform mutations. When the original version of something is changed it is considered a mutation</p>
  <h2>Immutable</h2>
  <p>The methods do not change the original thing but they simply return a new array</p>
