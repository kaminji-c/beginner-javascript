  <h2>Bind Call and Apply!</h2>
  <p>Use when the this value is not what you hoped</p>

  <ul class="wrapper">
    <li>
      <p>Bind, call, apply: will change the <u>scope</u> of (this) keyword is equal to inside of a function or a method
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The (this) keyword is defined where the function is being <u>called</u> and <b>not</b> where the function is
        being
        <u>defined</u>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We can use the (.bind) keyword to change where the (this) keyword is <u>defined</u></p>
      <p>Why is this useful? || Sometimes you might want to use a method of an object with some other information</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can use bind to prep a function that has arguments</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bind preloading with arguments that need to be called</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you need to bind a function and call it later, use bind</p>
  <p>If you need to bind a function and call it immediately, use call</p>

    const person = {
      name: 'cam cam',
      sayHi() {
        console.log(this); //returns person object
        console.log(`hey ${this.name}`);
        return `hey ${this.name}`;
      },
    }
    //sayHi is a  method, when called they get the (this) value (left of the dot) and see what they are bound against

    const jenna = { name: 'Jenna' };
    //const sayHi = person.sayHi;
    // running sayHi() in the console **this** is equal to the window why??? because there was nothing that the method was bound to on the left hand side

    //const sayHi = person.sayHi.bind(person);
    //create a function called sayHi, that when called that (this) keyword will equal whatever I pass in the bind()

    const sayHi = person.sayHi.bind({ name: 'Harry' });
    //const sayHi = person.sayHi.bind(jenna);
    //binding a function, bind is a method, (change the *this* keyword to be equal to a different object

    //query selector example
    //const $ = document.querySelector;
    //by calling bind against querySelector, we say when the $ function is run, use 'docuemnt' as 'this' value
    //this doesn't call the function it, it returns a new function which you can then store in a variable 
    const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document);
    const lookFor = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);

    const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper');
    const p = wrapper.querySelector('p');
    console.log(p);

    console.log($('p')); //does not work because taken away the method that it was called against, therefore it is not bound to anything
    console.log(lookFor('p'));

    //bind prep a function
    const bill = {
      total: 1000,
      calculate(taxRate) {
        return this.total + (this.total * taxRate);
      },
      describe(mealType, drinkType, taxRate) {
        console.log(`Your meal of ${mealType} with a drink of ${drinkType} was ${this.calculate(taxRate)}`)
      }

    }

    const total = bill.calculate(0.13);
    console.log(total);
    //storing this calc function in an external variable 
    //const calc = bill.calculate; //return NaN. not bound to anything
    //const calc = bill.calculate.bind(bill); bind to the original 
    //const calc = bill.calculate.bind({ total: 500 });
    //console.log(calc(0.13));
    //bind: preloading with arguments that need to be called
    const calc = bill.calculate.bind({ total: 500 }, 0.06);
    //why does this work? the first one will always be the *this* object, the additional ones will line up with the arguments that get passed
    console.log(calc()); //.bind returns a function that then needs to be called by itself

    //call and apply, work similar to bind but will call the functions for you
    const total2 = bill.calculate.call({ total: 500 }, 0.06);
    console.log(total2); //.call will do the same thing as bind but it will run the function for you

    //you can pass ***null*** if you don't care what ***this*** is
    const total3 = bill.calculate.apply({ total: 325 }, [0.60]);
    console.log(total3);
    //This function is almost identical to call(), except that call() accepts an argument list, while apply() accepts a single array of arguments â€” for example, func.apply(this, ['eat', 'bananas']) vs.func.call(this, 'eat', 'bananas').

    const myMeal = bill.describe.call(bill, 'pizza', 'coke', 0.13);
    console.log(myMeal);
    const myMeal2 = bill.describe.apply(bill, ['pizza', 'coke', 0.13]);
    console.log(myMeal2);
