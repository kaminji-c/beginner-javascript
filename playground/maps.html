  <p>Map is very similar to an Object. It is simply used to store data
  </p>
  <p>Benefit of the map:
    1. Map KEYS and values can be any type. In an Object only the value of the KEY can be any type.
  </p>
  <p>Sometimes in JS we have these things called DICTIONARIES which is a way to store additional meta data</p>
  <p>DOWNSIDES of a MAP:
    1. No literal notation
    2. You cannot store a function in it like an object can(methods)
    3.JSON does not handle maps
  </p>
  <ul class="prizes"></ul>

  <script>
    const person1 = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 200,
    };
    //You can use the reference of that object as a key in your map to store additional info inside of your map

    //DOWNSIDE OF MAP, There is not LITERAL, so you have to create a map this way, unlike an object: const object = {};, or an array: const array = [];
    const myMap = new Map();

    //.set() - add items to a map
    //entries are actual values in a map
    myMap.set('name', 'cam');
    myMap.set(100, 'This is a number');
    myMap.set(person1, 'Really Cool');
    myMap.age = 100; //if we use the object notation, it is not added to the same spot. It becomes a property of this map, not an actual entry 
    console.log(myMap);
    //console.log(myMap.get(person1));
    const score = 100;
    const prizes = new Map();
    //In an object you would have to use a string to look up the score
    prizes.set(100, 'Bear');
    prizes.set(200, 'Duck');
    prizes.set(300, 'Car');
    console.log(`You win a ${prizes.get(score)}`);
    //select that ul
    const ul = document.querySelector('.prizes');
    //Only gives values
    /*    prizes.forEach(entry => {
         console.log(entry);
       }); */
    //For both values we can use the FOR OF LOOP
    for (const [points, prize] of prizes) {
      //console.log(points, prize);
      const li = `<li>${points} - ${prize}</li>`;
      ul.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', li);
    }
    //.has()
    //.delete()
    //myMap.delete('name');

    //.size, similar to .length in objects
    //console.log(myMap.size);
    //Key takeaways: ORDER is guaranteed in a map. The order you put into a map is the order it will stay
//110
