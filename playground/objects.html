<h1>Objects</h1>
<p>Everything in JS is an object</p>
<p>Objects allow us to group together properties and values or keys and values</p>
<p>Uses: Storing related data, storing functionality
</p>
<p>Important to note: That objects are used where the order of the properties does not matter</p>
<p>Nested Objects are a thing!</p>

    //DIFFERENCE BETWEEN METHODS AND FUNCTIONS
    //Methods is a function that lives inside of an object
    //When you have a function that lives in a property in a object if is referred to as a method of that object.
    //Also  a shorthand way of writing methods. Look at the object above

    /* 1. When comparing values the triple equals ['===']: checks the type and value
       2. When you set one string variable to be another, the value is copied from one to another
       3. When OBJECTS and ARRAYS are copied by reference, same as MAPS and SETS
       4. This only goes one level deep, when you have objects/arrays inside an object you run into the same problem like number three

    /* WAYS TO COPY AN OBJECT
    1. VIA SPREAD: '...' three dot operator, used for taking every single item in an object and spreading into a new object
    2.Less popular method: Object.assign();

      console.log(data);
    };//IF you pass in an object or an array into a function and modify that object|array the external object|array will be updated
    //NOT the case for boolean, numbers, and strings 
    //TO AVOID BUGS, you pass the OBJECT|ARRAY as a copy using one of the references that we've done
